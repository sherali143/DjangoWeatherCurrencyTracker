## API Keys and URLs

To use the external APIs for weather and currency conversion, you need to acquire your own API keys and update the projectâ€™s configuration. Here is how you can set up your API keys and URLs:

- **Currency Conversion API**:
  - **API Key**: Obtain your API key from [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).
  - **API URL**: Format your URL as follows:
    ```python
    EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
    EXCHANGE_RATE_API_URL = f'https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/{EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY}/latest/USD'
    ```

- **Weather API**:
  - **API Key**: Obtain your API key from [WeatherStack](https://weatherstack.com/).
  - **API URL**: Format your URL as follows:
    ```python
    WEATHER_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
    WEATHER_API_URL = f'https://api.weatherstack.com/current?access_key={WEATHER_API_KEY}'
    ```

Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual API key in the project's configuration files.
